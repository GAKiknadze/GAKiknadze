I am glad to see you on my GitHub page. I am a passionate Python developer with experience in various projects. I use Python as my main programming language, and I like working with frameworks like Django and Flask. My stack also contains libraries for working with data, such as pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. I often use version control systems like Git to manage my projects. 

If you have any questions about my projects or Python in general, please ask them. I will be glad to help!
